# Subagents Directory

This directory is for project-specific or experimental agents.

Use the `/create-subagent` command to create new subagents here.

Subagents are distinct from global agents in that they are:
- **Project-specific** rather than global
- **Experimental** or temporary
- **Not part of the main agent registry**

Global agents are located in `/home/thoma/.claude/agents/`.
