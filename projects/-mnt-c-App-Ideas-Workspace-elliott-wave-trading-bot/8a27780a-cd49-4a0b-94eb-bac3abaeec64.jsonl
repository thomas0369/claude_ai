Consider multi-timeframe confluence (Daily → 4H → 1H → 15M)\n5. Respect Fibonacci ratios and Elliott Wave principles\n6. Account for current risk exposure and position sizing\n7. If the setup is tradeable but has conflicting signals, explain the conflicts\n\nELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW:\n- Wave 3 is never the shortest impulse wave\n- Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1\n- Wave 4 cannot overlap Wave 1 in an impulse (except in diagonals)\n- Fibonacci relationships: Wave 2 often 50-61.8%, Wave 4 often 38.2-50%\n- Wave 5 targets: 61.8%, 100%, or 161.8%

Let me examine the data carefully.\n\n**Analysis of the Setup:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Score of 89/194 exceeds the 75-point threshold\n- Clear bearish EMA structure across all timeframes\n- Stochastic deeply oversold (14-16) on lower timeframes, suggesting potential bounce\n- Elliott Wave Oscillator turned negative (-0.0018), confirming momentum shift\n- MACD declining across all timeframes\n- Fibonacci bounce identified at 61.8% retracement with 72% confidence\n\n**Critical Concerns:**\n1. **Conflicting Momentum:** Stochastic is turning UP from oversold (14→16), while we're considering a SHORT entry. This suggests an immediate counter-trend bounce is likely.\n2. **Extremely Weak ADX (22.63):** This indicates no strong trend, making directional trades risky.\n3. **Price Consolidation:** All timeframes show nearly identical close prices (154.19-154.24), indicating a tight range with no clear breakout.\n4. **Wave Count Uncertainty:** The data claims \"Wave 3 of larger degree Wave 5\" but provides no swing structure validation. Wave 3 should show strong momentum (high ADX), which contradicts the ADX of 22.63.\n5. **Risk:Reward Issue:** The suggested stop at 157.83 is 2.36% away, while TP at 144.66 is 6.18% away. With 8x leverage, the stop distance becomes very tight in real terms.\n6. **No Divergence:** No RSI/MACD divergence to confirm Wave 5 exhaustion.\n\n**Decision:** This is a HOLD. While the score exceeds 75 points, the setup has significant conflicts that reduce conviction below acceptable levels for a leveraged position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"signal\": \"hold\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.45,\n  \"position_size_eur\": 0,\n  \"leverage\": 5,\n  \"justification\": \"Setup score of 89 exceeds threshold, but critical conflicts exist: stochastic turning up from oversold contradicts SHORT timing, ADX of 22.63 shows weak trend unsuitable for Wave 3 momentum, and tight consolidation (154.19-154.24) lacks directional conviction.
