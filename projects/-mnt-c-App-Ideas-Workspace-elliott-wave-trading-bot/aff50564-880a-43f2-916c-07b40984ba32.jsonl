Only trade when setup scores ≥75 points (out of 194)\n2. Focus on fewer, larger, high-conviction positions\n3. Always provide explicit exit plans (stop loss, take profit, invalidation)\n4. Consider multi-timeframe confluence (Daily → 4H → 1H → 15M)\n5. Respect Fibonacci ratios and Elliott Wave principles\n6. Account for current risk exposure and position sizing\n7. If the setup is tradeable but has conflicting signals, explain the conflicts\n\nELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW:\n- Wave 3 is never the shortest impulse wave\n- Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1\n- Wave 4 cannot overlap Wave 1 in an impulse (except in diagonals)\n- Fibonacci relationships: Wave 2 often 50-61.8%, Wave 4 often 38.2-50%\n- Wave 5 targets: 61.8%, 100%, or 161.8% extension of Wave 1\n- Divergence at Wave 5 suggests trend exhaustion\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON):\n{\n  \"signal\": \"buy|sell|hold|close\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n  \"position_size_eur\":
