Let me examine the multi-timeframe data and scoring system.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Score of 108/194 exceeds the 75-point threshold for tradeable setups\n- Clear bearish structure across all timeframes (EMA 8 < EMA 21)\n- RSI showing extreme oversold on 1H (24.07), Daily (9.09), and 15M (12.62)\n- Stochastic at 0.40 on 1H and 0.27 on Daily (extreme oversold)\n- Fibonacci bounce from 0.618 level with 80% confidence\n- Wave count suggests Wave 3 of larger Wave 5 (strongest impulse wave potential)\n- Strong bearish momentum (EWO negative across all timeframes)\n- Risk:Reward of 2.6:1 is acceptable\n\n**Critical Concerns:**\n1. **Extreme Oversold Conditions**: RSI at 9.09 (Daily) and 24.07 (1H) indicates panic selling. This could lead to a sharp reversal bounce rather than continuation.\n2. **ADX = 0.0 on Daily**: This indicates NO trend strength whatsoever. Trading a \"Wave 3\" in a trendless market contradicts Elliott Wave principles.\n3. **Countertrend Risk**: All oscillators are at extreme lows, suggesting we'd be chasing a move that's already extended.\n4. **Wave Count Contradiction**: If we're in \"Wave 3 of larger degree Wave 5,\" we should see strong ADX and expanding momentum - but ADX is 0 and we're at oversold extremes.\n5. **Large Stop Distance**: 2.36% stop loss with 8x leverage = 18.88% account risk on a single trade (unacceptable).\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWhile the score exceeds 75 points, the setup has fundamental flaws:\n- The Wave 3 count is invalidated by weak ADX (Wave 3 should have the strongest momentum)\n- Extreme oversold readings suggest we're late to the move or due for a bounce\n- The risk is too high for a first trade with questionable trend strength\n\nThis is a classic case where the scoring system flags a signal, but deeper Elliott Wave analysis reveals the setup doesn't meet quality standards.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"signal\": \"hold\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.35,\n  \"position_size_eur\": 0,\n  \"leverage\": 3,\n  \"justification\": \"Despite 108-point score, the setup contradicts Elliott Wave principles.
