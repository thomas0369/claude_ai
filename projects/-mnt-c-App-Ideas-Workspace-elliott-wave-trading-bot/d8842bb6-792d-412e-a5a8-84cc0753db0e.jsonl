Consider multi-timeframe confluence (Daily → 4H → 1H → 15M)\n5. Respect Fibonacci ratios and Elliott Wave principles\n6. Account for current risk exposure and position sizing\n7. If the setup is tradeable but has conflicting signals, explain the conflicts\n\nELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW:\n- Wave 3 is never the shortest impulse wave\n- Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1\n- Wave 4 cannot overlap Wave 1 in an impulse (except in diagonals)\n- Fibonacci relationships: Wave 2 often 50-61.8%, Wave 4 often 38.2-50%\n- Wave 5 targets: 61.8%, 100%, or 161.8%

Let me examine the multi-timeframe structure and Elliott Wave count.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Score of 119/194 (well above 75 threshold) - HIGH quality signal\n- Clear bearish EMA structure across all timeframes (EMA 8 < EMA 21)\n- Strong downward momentum: Daily EWO collapsed from 169.80 to 5.94\n- RSI showing weakness: 15M at 28.05 (oversold bounce zone), 1H at 35.53, 4H at 32.26, Daily at 31.98\n- Price broke below multiple EMAs and is accelerating lower\n- Elliott Wave count suggests Wave 3 of larger Wave 5 (strongest impulse wave)\n- 1H Fibonacci bounce from 0.618 retracement with 80% confidence\n- Recent sharp decline: -3.93% move from 4111.21 to 3948.68 in 10 days\n- Risk:Reward of 2.6:1 is acceptable\n\n**Concerns:**\n- 15M Stochastic turning up from extreme oversold (5.98 → 31.65) - potential short-term bounce\n- RSI on 15M hit 13.06 (extreme oversold) - bounce likely before continuation\n- Daily ADX at 0.0 suggests weak trend strength (data may be incomplete)\n- Significant distance to stop loss (93.14 points = 2.36%)\n- We're entering after a sharp move - may get better entry on pullback\n\n**Decision:** This is a valid SHORT setup, but timing is critical. The 15M timeframe shows extreme oversold conditions with stochastic reversal pattern. I'll enter at current price with reduced position size due to short-term bounce risk, using the suggested 8x leverage since the score supports it.\n\n**Wave Count Validation:**\n- Wave 3 characteristics: Strong momentum (EWO declining), volume expansion implied by move speed\n- No Wave 1/4 overlap violation visible\n- Fibonacci relationships holding (0.618 bounce on 1H confirms corrective structure)\n- Target at 3702.76 represents reasonable Wave 3 extension\n\n```json\n{\n  \"signal\": \"sell\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.78,\n  \"position_size_eur\": 8.00,\n  \"leverage\": 8,\n  \"justification\": \"High-conviction Wave 3 short setup with 119/194 score.
