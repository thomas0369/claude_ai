Consider multi-timeframe confluence (Daily → 4H → 1H → 15M)\n5. Respect Fibonacci ratios and Elliott Wave principles\n6. Account for current risk exposure and position sizing\n7. If the setup is tradeable but has conflicting signals, explain the conflicts\n\nELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW:\n- Wave 3 is never the shortest impulse wave\n- Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1\n- Wave 4 cannot overlap Wave 1 in an impulse (except in diagonals)\n- Fibonacci relationships: Wave 2 often 50-61.8%, Wave 4 often 38.2-50%\n- Wave 5 targets: 61.8%, 100%, or 161.8%
