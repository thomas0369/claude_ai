Consider multi-timeframe confluence (Daily → 4H → 1H → 15M)\n5. Respect Fibonacci ratios and Elliott Wave principles\n6. Account for current risk exposure and position sizing\n7.

of Wave 1\n- Wave 4 cannot overlap Wave 1 in an impulse (except in diagonals)\n- Fibonacci relationships: Wave 2 often 50-61.8%, Wave 4 often 38.2-50%\n- Wave 5 targets: 61.8%, 100%, or 161.8%

Each timeframe should show different candle formations.\n\n3. **Wave Count Unclear**: The Daily timeframe claims \"Wave 3 of larger degree Wave 5\" but this is an impulsive continuation pattern that would suggest BULLISH bias, not SHORT.\n\n4. **ADX Contradiction**: Current ADX = 62.23 (strong trend), but Daily shows ADX = 0.0 (weak trend).\n\n5. **Risk Profile**: The suggested stop at 0.66881 is 2.36% away but we'd be using 8x leverage, meaning a 0.3% adverse move would lose 2.4% of capital - very aggressive for a first trade with conflicting signals.\n\n**Decision: HOLD**\n\nThis setup has too many internal contradictions and data quality issues to risk capital on.
