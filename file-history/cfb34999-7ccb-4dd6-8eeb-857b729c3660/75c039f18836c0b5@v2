## 🧠 Intelligent Placement Algorithm

The autonomous player used the following strategy:

### Algorithm Features:
1. **Valid Position Detection** - Scanned all 64 grid positions for each block
2. **Collision Detection** - Checked bounds and existing cells before placement
3. **Line Clearing Prediction** - Calculated potential line clears for each position
4. **Optimal Scoring** - Prioritized positions that would clear lines
5. **Coverage Optimization** - Maximized cell placement efficiency

### Placement Logic:
```
Score = (Potential Lines × 100) + Cell Coverage
```

The algorithm consistently chose positions that would:
- Clear horizontal rows when completing the 8th column
- Maximize the number of cells placed
- Avoid blocking future placements

## 🎯 Gameplay Pattern Analysis

### Line Clearing Pattern:
The autonomous player discovered an optimal strategy:

1. Place blocks across the first two rows
2. Complete row when reaching column 6-7
3. Line clears at regular intervals (every 4 moves)
4. Grid remains mostly empty (0% fill) due to efficient clearing

### Moves 1-100 Breakdown:

- **Moves 1-3**: Fill first row (columns 0, 2, 4)
- **Move 4**: Complete row → **Line Clear #1** (Score: 200)
- **Moves 5-7**: Refill row (columns 0, 2, 4)
- **Move 8**: Complete row → **Line Clear #2** (Score: 400)
- **Pattern continues** for 100 moves...
- **Move 100**: Final line clear → **Score: 5,000**

### Lines Cleared Timeline:
- Every 4 moves = 1 line cleared
- Total: 25 lines in 100 moves
- Efficiency: 25% line clear rate
