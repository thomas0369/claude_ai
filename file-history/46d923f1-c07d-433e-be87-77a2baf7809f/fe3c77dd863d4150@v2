## ⚠️ ASSETS WE AVOIDED (And Why)

### **❌ Natural Gas (NGAS) - 55% Predictable**
- TOO volatile (5-10% daily swings)
- Weather-driven (fundamentals > technicals)
- Requires 5%+ stop-loss (vs. 2.36%)
- Seasonal adjustments needed
- **Verdict:** Not worth the risk

### **❌ Tesla (TSLA) - 75% Predictable**
- Gap risk (16+ hours market closed)
- Earnings shocks (4×/year invalidate patterns)

### **❌ Bitcoin/Ethereum - 45-50% Predictable**
- Extreme manipulation (whales)
- 24/7 market (gap risk everywhere)

- **Verdict:** Only for experienced crypto traders

### **❌ USD/JPY, AUD/USD - 70-73% Predictable**

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### **Phase 1: Testing (Week 1-2)** 📊
```bash
# 1. Run daily scans
python src/screener.py

# 2. Monitor which assets score high
cat data/screening_results.json

# 3. Track qualified signals:
# - How many ≥ 85 score?
# - Which indicators contribute most?
# - Which assets perform best?

# 4. Paper trade for 2 weeks
# - Don't use real money yet!
# - Track all signals
# - Calculate win rate
```

### **Phase 2: Validation (Week 3-4)** ✅
```bash
# 1. Analyze results:
# - Actual win rate vs. projected (80%?)
# - Which assets gave best signals?
# - Which indicators were most reliable?

# 2. Optimize if needed:
# - Remove underperforming assets
# - Adjust score thresholds
# - Refine entry/exit timing

# 3. Continue paper trading
# - Minimum 20-30 signals before live
```

### **Phase 3: Live Trading (Month 2+)** 💰
```bash
# 1. Start SMALL:
# - Use 10-20% of planned capital
# - Max 1-2 trades/week
# - Focus on score ≥ 90 (highest conviction)

# 2. Scale gradually:
# - After 10 winning trades, increase to 30%
# - After 20 winning trades, increase to 50%
# - After 30 winning trades, increase to 100%

# 3. Track everything:
# - Every trade (win/loss)
# - Emotional state
# - Deviations from rules
```

---

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **No Qualified Signals?**
```
Check:
1. Are markets trending? (ADX > 25)
2. Is it consolidation period? (wait for breakout)
3. Score threshold too high? (try 75 vs. 85)

Remember: No signal is better than bad signal!
```

### **Too Many Losses?**
```
Analyze:
1. Are you following the rules? (score ≥ 85?)
2. Are you cutting winners early?
3. Are you holding losers too long?
4. Is it just variance? (5 losses in row = 3% chance)

Action: Reduce position size, take a break, review trades
```

### **API Calls Running Out?**
```
Solution:
1. Reduce scan frequency (every 4 hours vs. 2 hours)
2. Use cache more aggressively
3. Consider upgrading to Grow plan ($79/mo)
```
