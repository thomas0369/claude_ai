## 💡 Pro Tips for Intraday Trading

### **1. Time-of-Day Matters:**
- **Best:** First hour (9:30-10:30 EST) - highest volatility
- **Good:** Last hour (15:00-16:00 EST) - position squaring
- **Avoid:** Lunch hour (12:00-14:00 EST) - low volume, choppy

### **2. Day Selection:**
- **Best:** Monday, Tuesday, Friday (trending days)
- **Good:** Wednesday, Thursday
- **Avoid:** Days before/after major holidays

### **3. News Events:**
- **Avoid:** Trading 5 minutes before/after major news (Fed, NFP, CPI)
- **Trade:** The retracement after initial spike (safer)

### **4. Risk Management:**
- **Max risk per trade:** 0.5-1% of capital
- **Max daily loss:** 2% of capital (stop trading for day)
- **Max trades per day:** 5 (overtrading kills accounts)

### **5. Position Sizing:**
- Use **fixed fractional** method
- Example: $10,000 account, 1% risk = $100 max loss per trade
- If stop loss = 0.5%, position size = $20,000 notional (2x leverage)
